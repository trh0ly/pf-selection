# Implications of different risk management strategies on the value/risk profile of an overall position

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:

This project aims to demonstrate to students the implications of different risk management strategies on the value and risk components of an overall position. Real capital market data can be used to determine a naively diversified portfolio and an optimal portfolio according to the Sharpe ratio. The distribution functions resulting from the overall positions are then visualized on the basis of a historical simulation and the variance-covariance method. Furthermore, different risk measures are applied and compared with each other on the basis of these distribution functions.
